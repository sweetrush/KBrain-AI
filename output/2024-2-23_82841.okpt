Here's an example of a Python function that uses the `subprocess` module to call the `espeak` command and read out the input text:

```python
import subprocess

def read_text_with_espeak(text, voice="en-us"):
    try:
        subprocess.call(['espeak', '-v', voice, text])
    except OSError:
        print("Error: espeak is not installed or accessible.")

# Example usage:
read_text_with_espeak("Hello, this is a test.", "en-us")
```

In this function, `subprocess.call` is used to execute the `espeak` command with the specified voice and input text. Make sure the `espeak` command is installed on your system before using this function.
